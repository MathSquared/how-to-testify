Testifying before the Texas Legislature
=

*Alex Meed*

There's been a lot of attention devoted lately to national politics. But there's another political arena that deserves the same amount of focus, or maybe more: your state legislature. Your state representatives and senators decide many of the policies that affect you; for instance, some of the bills filed in this session of the Texas Legislature include a ban on sanctuary cities, a bathroom bill, and a sharply-trimmed budget.

You can affect state legislative proceedings in many of the same ways you can affect national legislation, such as through calling or writing your legislator, or just voting in elections. But this guide will cover another important way to act: by testifying.

First, a little bit about me. I'm a student at the University of Texas at Austin, majoring in Computer Science. On Thursday, February 2, 2017, I testified against [SB 4](http://www.legis.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=85R&Bill=SB4), a bill to defund sanctuary cities. I also have years of competitive speaking experience. I've drawn this guide from the knowledge I gained by testifying myself, as well as information I gathered from the Internet and from my personal network as I prepared to testify.

Almost every bill that passes through the Texas Legislature goes through a **committee**. The committees are small groups of legislators that specialize in a particular issue; for instance, the aforementioned SB 4 went before the Senate State Affairs Committee. Committees hold **hearings** to consider a bill. Most hearings will invite **public testimony**, where anyone can speak directly to the committee in support of or opposition to the bill. SB 4 was particularly controversial, drawing hundreds of people to the Capitol to testify. But most hearings only have a few witnesses, usually from major lobbying groups or think tanks. I'm hoping to change that, because testimony is a great way to alter the course of the Texas Legislature.

I'll discuss the testimony process in chronological order, ranging from preparing for your day at the Capitol to your three minutes before the committee. I suggest you **don't read this all at once**; it's way too much to digest in a single sitting. Instead, I recommend you read each section as it becomes applicable. For instance, read the sections on arriving at the Capitol and testifying a day or two before the hearing.

Enjoy!

Finding a hearing
-

So you want to testify before the Texas Legislature. That's great! First, you need to find the issue you're testifying on.

### Finding a bill

Every bill in the Texas Legislature has a **bill number**, which is unique to that **session** of the Legislature. (A session is a period of two years, between which there are no legislative elections. The entire Legislature restarts when it moves to a new session.) For instance, the sanctuary cities bill that I testified on has bill number SB 4 (the SB stands for Senate Bill). In order to testify on a bill, you first need to find its bill number.

Your biggest resource for this is [Texas Legislature Online](http://legis.state.tx.us), or **TLO**. ([Mobile site](http://txlegis.com).) This contains information about every bill that's been filed, including the legislator that introduced it, any actions taken (such as votes), and the bill's full text. You can go to *Legislation > Bill Lookup* (desktop) or *Bill Lookup* (mobile) to view a bill given its number, or *Search* (desktop) to find a bill given specific criteria.

You can also find bill numbers through the media. Not all news outlets list bill numbers, but some do. If the article doesn't provide a bill number, it may list the bill's author or sponsor; you can use that information in TLO's search feature to locate the bill.

### Identifying the hearing

Once you've found the bill, you need to identify its committee. This should be listed on the bill page, as well as in the list of actions at the bottom (something like "Referred to *committee name*"). This committee will schedule a hearing for the bill; if you see an entry in the action list labeled "Scheduled for public hearing on...", that date is when the bill will be heard.

Once you've identified the committee and the hearing date, you need to check the **hearing notice**. This contains the location and time of the hearing, as well as any limitations on your testimony. On TLO, under *Committees > Upcoming Meetings* (desktop) or *Committee Meetings* (mobile), you can see a list of future meetings by date and committee. Once you've found the hearing you're looking for, clicking an icon at the right (desktop) or the committee name (mobile) will bring up the notice.

There are five **things to look for on the notice**:

- The **time and room** of the hearing. All hearings are at the Texas Capitol, and usually start in the morning, but may be in different hearing rooms or start at different times.
- What **bills will be considered**. Some hearings will discuss multiple bills at once. Make sure you're testifying on the right one. Also note that hearings generally consider groups of related bills, so some of the others at your hearing of choice might interest you.
- Whether the hearing accepts **public testimony**. Invited testimony isn't what you're looking for. If the notice doesn't mention public testimony, **you can't testify**!
- The **time limit** on oral testimony. This is usually three minutes, but may be shorter for high-profile hearings.
- The **number of copies** to bring for written testimony.

The last two items will be more important later, when you are preparing your testimony.

### Useful sources of information

Apart from persistently checking TLO, there are other ways to get information about a bill.

First, TLO offers a robust **bill alert system**. The TLO website, under *My TLO*, will let you create an account with your email address. Then, you can add bills to your email alert list, and you'll get a nice email whenever the status of the bill changes (for instance, when it is referred to a committee or when a hearing is scheduled).

Second, **the media** can be a great way to follow controversial bills. Sources specific to Texas, such as the Texas Tribune, often post updates on when hearings are scheduled on high-profile legislation. They'll also give you information you can't get on TLO, like when SB 4 got [modified](https://www.texastribune.org/2017/02/01/texas-senate-adds-muscle-anti-sanctuary-city-legis/) a day before the hearing.

Preparing your testimony
-

Once you've found out when the hearing is happening, you need to prepare to testify before the committee.

### Planning your approach

As you put together your testimony, you need to decide two crucial items: your position on the bill and the format of your testimony.

All testimony takes one of three **positions**: for, against, or on (if you wish to offer information but remain neutral on the bill). Make sure you know which side you're on, and be aware that the correct side might not be obvious; for instance, since SB 4 was a bill to ban sanctuary cities, a supporter of sanctuary cities would testify against SB 4.

Testimony may be **formatted** in one of several ways: oral, written, or both. (You can also register your position on the bill without giving testimony.) Oral testimony is a short speech given to the members of the committee, possibly followed by questioning from the members. Written testimony is a paper packet given to the legislators. If you don't want to or don't have time to speak, you can submit written testimony only; if you don't have time to write up your remarks, or access to a printer, you can opt for a solely oral approach. Optimally, you should do both. Keep in mind that some legislators won't be at the hearing, so not everyone will hear your oral testimony, but everyone can read the written testimony during or after the hearing.

### Types of testimony

There are two basic approaches you can take to argue your position on a bill.

**Objective** testimony relies on logic, facts, and figures. An objective witness cites sources, provides logically-organized points, and uses plenty of statistics. Anyone who's done competitive debate, extemporaneous speaking, or (especially) congressional debate will feel right at home with this approach. You can fit about two separate, complete arguments into a two- to three-minute period, and might be able to squeeze in a third point if you're given three minutes.

By contrast, **narrative** testimony tells a story. A narrative witness attempts to sway the committee with emotion, telling their own story or that of someone they know, and aims to show the legislators the human impact of their proposal. Narrative testimony is excellent if you're personally affected by the bill, since you're then the best suited to give your own unique perspective. Focus on telling one story; try not to tell multiple narratives, since you'll probably run out of time in the middle of one of them.

There's disagreement on which of these two approaches is most effective. My personal opinion is that both are important; the effect of hard numbers and figures can be amplified with stories that humanize some of those figures. A solid balance of both approaches builds a cogent case for your side.

At hearings with many witnesses, there will be a combination of objective and narrative witnesses. They will create that balance between the two approaches, so you really only need to pick one. For less controversial bills, where you have longer to testify, you can optionally combine the approaches; either start with a narrative and then show its broader impact with numbers, or start with data and then personalize it at the end.

### Conducting research

Now's the time to gather information that you'll need in your testimony, and to back up your position for questioning. Even if you're taking a purely narrative approach, this information may influence how you present your story. You should also know more about the bill than you state in your oral testimony, because legislators have the option to ask you questions about anything you say.

First, **read the bill**. This probably sounds terrifying, but most bills are fairly short. Reading the bill is also very important; if a legislator asks you "Have you read the bill?" during questioning, answering "no" can severely damage your credibility. The Texas Legislative Council has an excellent [resource](http://www.tlc.state.tx.us/docs/legref/readingabill.pdf) on reading bills. Some things to note:
- Watch for any planned **amendments** to the bill, and read them. These are sometimes listed on the TLO page, but not always. Check TLO and major Texas news sources frequently in the run-up to the hearing. Note that amendments probably won't be formally proposed until the day of the hearing, so they won't show up on TLO, but you might see chatter about planned amendments in the news media.
- Pay attention to the **nuances** of the bill. Many bills do one thing primarily, but also have other provisions. For instance, SB 4, while it bans sanctuary cities, also bans state officers from making a traffic stop solely because of presumed immigration status (in most cases). Legislators use these parts of a bill to counter common arguments against it, and make their own arguments in favor of the bill. You should know what's in the bill so that you can discuss any aspect of it, and beat back any arguments based on its more arcane portions.

Second, the TLO page should contain a non-partisan **analysis** of the bill. This usually restates the bill's legalese in slightly-beautified but nearly-identical legalese, but it's still not a bad idea to look it over. The analysis also contains a statement of rationale for the bill written by its author or sponsor, which can help inform your testimony.

Third, many bills come with **fiscal notes** that outline any costs to the state. These are usually posted on TLO right before a committee hearing. The Texas Legislature absolutely hates spending money, so make sure you consider the fiscal note in your arguments.

Fourth, know the **members of the committee** and look at their portraits. Take special note of the chair and vice chair, who I'll discuss later. This can help you refer to senators by name during the hearing, both when answering a question they pose and when discussing something they said earlier. (Another approach is to just listen to what the chair calls them during the hearing&mdash;still, you should at least know the names of the committee members, so that you can match the name you hear to a member.)

Fifth, if you're preparing objective testimony, research the **facts behind your case**. You probably already know why you support your side of the bill, but an objective approach requires reliably-sourced analysis and data. If you're attending a high-profile hearing, try to dig up unique arguments that you don't think anyone else will make&mdash;after hours of hearing the same arguments over and over again, everyone will appreciate a change of pace.

Some of the first few items I mentioned, like the bill text and analysis, might be useful to have printed during the hearing; you can print them when you print your written testimony. Note that bills and analyses in PDF form print on **legal-size paper**.

### Written testimony

Written testimony should describe the totality of your position on the issue. For objective testimony, think up any arguments you have to support your side of the bill, and include them separated into sections. For narrative testimony, simply write up your story.

Written testimony should be prepared as a formal paper. Format your document well, in English sentences. Cite sources if you need to with footnotes or a bibliography. There's no page limit that I'm aware of, except for how much you can afford to print.

Make sure you print the **right number of copies**, which will be listed in the hearing notice. You'll probably want to go to a print shop. Save paper by printing double-sided, and staple each copy of your testimony.

I've uploaded my SB 4 written testimony as `sample-testimony.pdf` in this repository. If you're viewing this on the Web, you can view the [Web-hosted version](https://github.com/MathSquared/how-to-testify/blob/master/sample-testimony.pdf).

### Oral testimony

Oral testimony is incredibly nerve-wracking. You're seated at a small table, facing some of the most powerful people in the state, given three minutes or less to make your point. I've participated in competitive speech and debate for over five years, and I was still shaking the first time I testified. Nonetheless, if you channel that nervous energy, you can immensely strengthen your case with oral testimony.

There are two phases to oral testimony: preparing it beforehand and actually delivering it. I'll discuss preparation here and save the delivery part for later in this guide.

A common practice is to simply read words verbatim from a sheet. This is a valid approach, especially if you're an inexperienced speaker. But the best testimony is **extemporaneous**; with only a few short notes in front of you, you just talk&mdash;exactly as if you were having a one-sided conversation with the committee. Testimony read from a sheet often ends up sounding monotonous, boring, and stilted; extemporaneous testimony appears confident, authentic, and trustworthy. If you do read from a sheet, at least read in a conversational tone and avoid any big words.

Objective oral testimony should simply **summarize** your position. A detailed exposition is what your written testimony is for. Give the legislators enough information to know what your views are, but defer most of the specifics to the paper. Also, you'll need to **select your arguments**; you'll only be able to present two or maybe three at most, so pick the ones that (a) are most powerful and (b) haven't already been said in the hearing, or need additional support based on the arguments that others have made.

Organize your testimony in three parts:
1. The **introduction** should include your name, any organization you represent, and your position on the bill. You don't need to preview your arguments, unlike in competitive speech.
2. The **body** is where you make your points or tell your story.
3. The **conclusion** is a call to action, which summarizes your testimony, restates your position, and urges the members to vote for or against the bill.

In large hearings, **be flexible**. Someone will say one of your arguments, or make an argument of their own that you just have to refute. Don't be caught up in a plan for which arguments you present or how you frame your story. I had three specific plans written on paper for which arguments I would select, but by the time I got to speak I had scrapped them all and formed a new one in my head.

Finally, be sure to **practice** your testimony, multiple times, with a timer running. This does two things: it helps calm your nerves (because you're not delivering your testimony for the first time in the hearing room), and it makes sure you don't go overtime.

My oral testimony on SB 4 is at around 4:38:30 in [this video](http://tlcsenate.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?clip_id=11651). As you can tell, this was a long hearing.

### Pre-registering

If you don't have an account with Capitol Witness Registration, creating one now will save time at the Capitol. Create an account at the [registration system](https://www.mytxlegis.legis.state.tx.us/hwrspublic/default.aspx) and enter your information. (The Texas House maintains the system, but it works for both House and Senate hearings.) At the Capitol, you can use this account to pre-fill your contact information into the on-site registration form, saving you time.

### What to bring

- Your **written testimony**. Make sure you have the **number of copies** specified in the hearing notice. Double-check the notice to make sure it hasn't changed. You can also bring **extra copies** in case one gets damaged, or to give to the press and anyone you meet. Ten extra is more than enough.
- Any **written reference materials** you may want for your oral testimony.
- **Pen and paper** to take notes during the hearing (so you can adjust your own arguments in response to what other people say), or for networking purposes.
- If you'd like, **business cards** to give to allies you meet at the hearing, for networking purposes.
- Appropriate **attire**. The minimum you should wear is a nice top (button-up for men) and dark, non-distressed, non-ripped jeans. Many witnesses wear some form of business casual. Some people wear a suit (with a business-appropriate tie for men). I personally wear a suit and tie whenever I testify orally, and recommend that you do the same if possible, especially at smaller hearings; however, suits are not required, as long as your attire shows respect for the committee.

### What not to bring

- **Weapons**, unless you're a CHL holder. State troopers will confiscate them.
- **Signs or placards** are not permitted during legislative hearings.

The day of the hearing
-

It's game time! Now's your time to shine at the Capitol.

### Getting to the Capitol

The Capitol opens at 7:00a on weekdays. For hearings that are early and large, you'll want to arrive around an hour before the hearing starts, but after 7:00a. For less controversial hearings, you can show up a bit closer to the hearing start time, because there won't be as many people registering.

The Capitol is located in the northern downtown area, occupying about sixteen blocks bounded by 11th St, 15th St, Colorado St, and San Jacinto Blvd. Here are some directions, organized by origin and mode of transportation:

- Walking from the UT campus: walk south four blocks from MLK. The most centrally-aligned street to the Capitol is Congress Ave, located immediately south of the Blanton, which is itself south of Speedway. There's currently construction at the south end of Speedway, though, so you'll have to go around. I recommending walking south on University (the street that intersects with 21st in front of the Littlefield Fountain), turning left on MLK and then right on Congress.
- Walking from downtown: walk north or south until you reach 11th or 15th St, then walk east or west until you get to the Capitol. Alternatively, walk east or west to Colorado St, Congress Ave, Brazos St, or San Jacinto Blvd, then north or south to the Capitol. (Downtown, streets are "W \_th St" west of Congress and "E \_th St" east of Congress.)
- Driving from IH-35, from the north: take exit 234C, then turn right on 12th St. Visitor parking is on your right after Trinity St.
- Driving from IH-35, from the south (best for Riverside): take exit 235A. Make a U-turn, then turn right on 12th St. Visitor parking is on your right after Trinity St.
- Driving from MoPac: exit Enfield and turn east onto Enfield Rd, which later becomes 15th St. Make a right on San Jacinto Blvd, after you see the Capitol on your right. Visitor parking is on your left after 13th St.
- Driving from Lamar or Guadalupe, from the north (best for much of West Campus and North Campus): turn left onto 15th St. Make a right on San Jacinto Blvd, after you see the Capitol on your right. Visitor parking is on your left after 13th St.
- Public transit from West Campus: walk to Guadalupe and take the 801 or 803 southbound to Capitol Station. Frequency: 15min. Do not rely on the 642 West Campus bus; it doesn't start early enough for early hearings.
- Public transit from North Campus: take the 801, 803, or 5 southbound to Capitol Station, or the 7 southbound to 12th & San Jacinto. Frequency: 15min for 801, 803, and 7; 30min for 5.
- Public transit from Riverside: take the 100 inbound to 12th & Trinity. Get on the bus on the north side of Riverside Dr, at its intersections with Montopolis Dr, Crossing Pl, or Town Creek Dr. Frequency: 30min. Do not rely on the Riverside campus shuttles; they don't start early enough for early hearings.

If you're anywhere near the Capitol, the large dome shape is hard to miss. Walk towards it. The entrances are on the broad sides of the building (the north and south).

Security officers with the Texas Department of Public Safety will X-ray your belongings, and you will pass through a metal detector unless you hold a CHL. You do not need an ID.

### Getting to the hearing

Most hearings are in hearing rooms in the Capitol. View the [floor plan](http://www.tspb.texas.gov/plan/maps/doc/capitol_building_maps/capitol_building_guide.pdf). You enter on the first floor.

For rooms in the Capitol proper, the first digit is the floor (G, 1, 2, 3, or 4), the second is the wing (N, S, E, or W), and later digits denote the room. Elevators are just behind the security checkpoints at both main entrances; there are also restrooms near the North Wing elevators. There are large staircases immediately east and west of the Capitol rotunda that lead directly to the second floor.

Rooms in the Extension, an underground area to the north, have room numbers starting with E1 or E2; E1 is above E2. You can take the North Wing elevators directly to the Extension floors, or take the stairs on the north side of the ground floor (which can be accessed from the north elevators, or stairwells immediately east and west of the Capitol rotunda).

Major hearings are in the House or Senate Chamber on the second floor. The House is to the west, the Senate to the east. There is little seating in the chamber; if it fills up, you may need to watch from the third floor gallery or an overflow room. You'll be called a few minutes before you are scheduled to testify so that you can walk to the chamber.

### Registration

The first thing you should do when you arrive is register. You can do this at the kiosks outside the hearing room; note that lines are long and chaotic for major hearings. You can also use your mobile device, though the site tends to be glitchy; the URL is [hwrs.house.state.tx.us](http://hwrs.house.state.tx.us) for the House and [swrs.senate.state.tx.us](http://swrs.senate.state.tx.us) for the Senate. Be aware that this only works on the Public-Capitol Wi-Fi network, so you have to be at the Capitol in order to register.

During registration, you'll be asked to state your position on the bill, select the format of your testimony, enter your contact information, and swear to tell the truth. If you've preregistered your contact information, you'll be given an option to enter your credentials during the registration process.

Once you register, you can walk into the hearing room. Also, if you're testifying orally, now's a good time to **use the restroom and grab a drink of water**; once the hearing starts, you won't want to leave until you're called to testify.

During the hearing
-

Walk in. Grab a seat. You'll be in this room for a while&mdash;possibly hours at controversial hearings. Get comfortable.

### People

A committee hearing is buzzing with activity. You should know who everyone is.

The **members** are the legislators who sit on the committee. They sit on the **dais** at the front of the room (at large hearings in the House or Senate Chamber, they may instead sit at a table). Be aware that not all of the members will probably be present during the entire hearing; they might be serving on other committees, or need to step out to attend to other business. The members are led by the **chair**, who runs the meeting and enforces the rules. If the chair can't attend the hearing or has to step out temporarily, the **vice chair** takes over (but is still known as the "chair" whenever they're in charge). Legislators who are not on the committee may also be present behind the dais; they may ask you questions but will not vote on whether the bill makes it out of committee.

The **staff** are employees of the legislators, the committees, or the state government who help keep everything running smoothly. The **clerk** is a staff member who sits next to the chair on the dais, and calls the roll during votes or to take attendance. You will hand your written testimony to an assistant clerk, who is usually seated in front of the dais.

At major hearings, members of the **press** will float around and possibly block your view of the hearing.

Then, of course, there are witnesses and observers. Some are **invited witnesses**, handpicked by the committee to give important information. They testify first and are not subject to time limits. Other people like you are **public witnesses**.

### Behavior

First, you should know what is expected of you as an audience member. Committee hearings are very formal affairs with strict rules, and many of those rules affect you.

When you walk in, you may sit anywhere (except that the first couple of rows may be reserved). Additionally, if you're submitting written but not oral testimony, give it to the assistant clerk. (If you're submitting both kinds of testimony, you'll give your written testimony to the assistant clerk when you are called to testify orally.)

You may take **photos**, but **may not record audio or video** unless you are a credentialed journalist.

Non-disruptive **cell phone use** is fine, and may be useful if you want to check TLO, the media, or another resource during the hearing. However, make sure to **silence your phone**, including alarms.

You can **leave and re-enter the hearing at any time**. But if you're testifying orally, beware: if your name is called when you're out of the room, you may be skipped.

Committee hearings are steeped in parliamentary procedure. Any **interruptions** from the audience, including applause or laughter, are generally prohibited (though a few chuckles at a good line from a legislator are probably fine). The chair will tap the gavel to ask the audience to quiet down, and has the authority to kick everyone out of the room if needed. Also, be aware that interruptions slow down the hearing, because the chair has to wait for the interruption to stop before proceeding.

**Do not step into the area where the committee members sit**. Legislators and staff will do so. You are not a legislator or a staff member (and if you are, this entire guide probably doesn't apply to you). You will be arrested.

### Flow of the hearing

The chair will start the hearing by tapping the gavel and announcing, "The *committee name* Committee will come to order. The clerk will call the roll." The clerk will then briefly take attendance.

At this point, the business of the committee will begin. They might have leftover items to consider; for instance, at the SB 4 hearing, the committee started by voting up several bills that were considered the previous day.

Consideration of each bill proceeds as follows:

1. **Opening statements**, at least one by the bill's author or sponsor, and possibly others. Any legislator present may question speakers during these statements.
2. **Invited testimony** by witnesses hand-picked by the committee.
3. **Public testimony**, which is when you'll be called.
4. Possibly a **vote** on the bill.

At the end, the chair will declare the hearing adjourned and tap the gavel.

### Glossary

Here are some terms you might hear in the hearing, from legislators or witnesses.

- The committee **adjourns** at the end of the meeting.
- The **AG** is the Texas Attorney General, whose office issues legal opinions and essentially serves as the state's law firm. (Other state government departments have their own acronyms, but the AG is perhaps the one you'll hear the most.)
- The **author** of a bill is the legislator who introduced it, and serves as the chief advocate for the bill. Other legislators may choose to become **coauthors** to express strong support for a bill. Bills can have an absurd amount of coauthors (there have been bills coauthored by literally every single Republican in the Texas Senate).
- The chair will order staff and law enforcement to **clear the gallery** if the audience is too disruptive.
- Instead of approving the original bill, the committee may approve a **committee substitute** instead, which is a changed version of the bill.
- Committee members sit on the **dais**, a raised platform with name placards.
- **Discretionary spending** is any money the state chooses to spend, as opposed to any it is required to spend by law.
- The **fiscal note** is a nonpartisan assessment of how much a bill will cost to the state.
- **Invited testimony** is testimony by witnesses hand-picked by the committee.
- The chair will often invite a **panel** of more than one witness up at a time. The witnesses on the panel will testify one by one. The term **panel** is also used in the media as a synonym for a committee.
- **Public testimony** is testimony by members of the public, not hand-picked by the committee.
- A **recess** is a short break in the middle of the hearing.
- After considering a bill, the committee may vote to **report to the full house**. The different manners of reporting correspond to what the committee thinks of the bill. The committee may also not report on a bill, in which case the bill dies.
- A **resource witness** is an invited witness, often from a government agency, who testifies on (not for or against) a bill. The purpose is to provide crucial information to the committee from government agencies affected by the bill.
- Each session of the Texas Legislature runs for 140 days. The last day of a session is known as ***sine die***.
- Once a bill passes one chamber of the Legislature, it moves to the other chamber. In that second chamber, instead of an author, the bill has a **sponsor**.
- Some committees have **subcommittees**. These are "committees within committees"; more specifically, they are subsets of the full committee that can consider a bill and report to the full committee.
- A **witness** is anyone testifying in a hearing.

### What to listen for

Testimony, especially objective testimony, can be much more effective if you listen to and engage with what else is said in the hearing. This is completely optional, but it makes you sound like a more informed witness, and can help deepen the lines of reasoning discussed in the hearing. Here are my tips on that.

This engagement strategy requires that you **take notes**. Write down anything you agree with or wish to respond to. Also, if it was said by a legislator or high-profile witness, writing down their title and last name never hurts (so you can refer to them by name when you testify).

Your notes should cover two things. First, listen to **what's being said** in the hearing. This is so that you don't repeat the same thing over and over again, but also so that you can additional support to an ally's argument. Second, take note of **arguments you can rebut**; you can pick a few of them to weave into your oral testimony.

### When you are called

At some point, the chair will call you by name to testify. At that point, walk up to the table and sit down. Don't speak until the chair tells you to start. (At large hearings, you might be called twice: once to walk to the hearing site if you're in an overflow room, and the next time to actually testify.) If you're not there when called, you might be skipped, so be careful (the chair might call your name again a few minutes later if they skip you the first time). Keep in mind that you might be seated in a panel with multiple witnesses, who you may or may not know. You'll speak one at a time.

As I mentioned in the section on preparing oral testimony, organize your testimony into an introduction, body, and conclusion. The intro should take about ten to fifteen seconds, and the conclusion anywhere from fifteen to thirty. There will be a timer in front of you that you can use to pace yourself.

You must start by stating three things: your name, affilliation, and position on the bill. The most formal way to do so is as follows:

> Mr. Chairman (or Madam Chair), members of the committee, thank you for hearing me today. My name is *your name*. I am here representing *organization name, or "myself"*, and I am speaking *for/against/on* the bill.

In practice, though, almost anything is fine, as long as you include those three elements.

There are some **behavioral norms** to follow:

- Don't directly address anyone other than the chair (or, during questions, the person who asked you the question). Refer to them in the third person ("Senator Smith says", not "Senator Smith, you said"). It's considered rude to directly argue with someone unless they were the one who recognized you to speak.
- Know how to address the chair. I generally address the chair as "Mr. Chairman" for men and "Madam Chair" for women; there are other acceptable forms, but these seem to be the most common. Make sure you consider the gender of who's actually in charge of the meeting when you get called; this could be the person listed as the committee chair or vice chair.
- Oppose the bill, not the person. The hearing is about a particular issue, not the character of whoever introduced it. Making personal attacks from the witness stand just antagonizes the people behind the dais, and the chair might cut you off in extreme cases. (This isn't meant to discourage you from expressing your feelings about an issue while testifying. I understand that many of the issues debated in hearings have major impacts on people, and anger, sadness, and fear are often understandable reactions. But while speaking strongly against a bill is acceptable and encouraged, insulting someone during your testimony is not something I would recommend.)

Note that while most questioning (if any) will happen after you speak, **legislators can interrupt you** with questions (though this is rare). The clock does not stop if a legislator asks a question during your testimony. The clock also doesn't stop for applause or other audience interruptions, so I recommend you keep going if something like that happens so you can make best use of your time.

**Time limits** are strictly enforced. If the timer goes off, ask the chair if you may finish your sentence or your thought. Going beyond that will just make the chair mad at you and take time away from others who also want to testify.

After you testify, legislators may ask you **questions**. Answer them honestly and as well as you can. It's OK if you don't know the answer to something. If a legislator asks you a question you don't know, you can optionally offer to look it up after the hearing and contact their office with your results. If you do make such a commitment, follow through as soon as possible.

### When you're done

Congrats! You've testified before the Texas Legislature. You can stay to watch the rest of the hearing, grab food at the Capitol Grill, or just leave. In any event, know that you've added your voice to a worthy cause and had a real impact on Texas politics.
