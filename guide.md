Testifying before the Texas Legislature
=

*Alex Meed*

With the election of Donald Trump, there's been a lot of attention devoted lately to national politics. But there's another political arena that deserves the same amount of focus, or maybe more: your state legislature. Your state representatives and senators decide many of the policies that affect you; for instance, some of the bills filed in this session of the Texas Legislature include a ban on sanctuary cities, a bathroom bill, and a sharply-trimmed budget.

You can affect state legislative proceedings in many of the same ways you can affect national legislation, such as through calling or writing your legislator, or just voting in elections. But this guide will cover another important way to act: by testifying.

First, a little bit about me. I'm a student at the University of Texas at Austin, majoring in Computer Science (hence why this is on Github). On Thursday, February 2, 2017, I testified against [SB 4](http://www.legis.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=85R&Bill=SB4), a bill to defund sanctuary cities. I also have years of competitive speaking experience. I've drawn this guide from the knowledge I gained by testifying myself, as well as several online sources whose identities have since escaped me.

Almost every bill that passes through the Texas Legislature goes through a **committee**. The committees are small groups of legislators that specialize in a particular issue; for instance, the aforementioned SB 4 went before the Senate State Affairs Committee. Committees hold **hearings** to consider a bill. Most hearings will invite **public testimony**, where anyone can speak directly to the committee in support of or opposition to the bill. SB 4 was particularly controversial, drawing hundreds of people to the Capitol to testify. But most hearings only have a few witnesses, usually from major lobbying groups or think tanks. I'm hoping to change that&mdash;because testimony is a great way to alter the course of the Texas Legislature.

I'll discuss the testimony process in chronological order, ranging from preparing for your day at the Capitol to your three minutes before the committee. I suggest you **don't read this all at once**; it's way too much to take in at once. Instead, read each section as it becomes applicable, and apply those lessons to your testimony.

Enjoy!

Finding a hearing

### Finding a bill

So you want to testify before the Texas Legislature. That's great! First, you need to find the issue you're testifying on.

Every bill in the Texas Legislature has a **bill number**, which is unique to that session of the Legislature (a period of time without any intervening elections). For instance, the sanctuary cities bill that I testified on has bill number SB 4 (the SB stands for Senate Bill). In order to testify on a bill, you first need to find its bill number.

Your biggest resource for this is [Texas Legislature Online](http://legis.state.tx.us), or **TLO**. ([Mobile site](http://txlegis.com).) This contains information about every bill that's been filed, as well as the legislator that introduced it. You can go to *Legislation > Bill Lookup* (desktop) or *Bill Lookup* (mobile) to view a bill given its number, or *Search* (desktop) to find a bill given specific criteria.

### Identifying the hearing

Once you've found the bill, you need to identify its committee. This should be listed on the bill page, as well as in the list of actions at the bottom (something like "Referred to *committee name*"). This committee will schedule a hearing for the bill; if you see an entry in the action list labeled "Scheduled for public hearing on...", that date is when the bill will be heard.

Once you've identified the committee and the hearing date, you need to check the **hearing notice**. This contains the location and time of the hearing, as well as any limitations on your testimony. Under *Committees > Upcoming Meetings* (desktop) or *Committee Meetings* (mobile), you can see a list of future meetings by date and committee. Once you've found the hearing you're looking for, clicking an icon at the right (desktop) or the committee name (mobile) will bring up the notice.

There are four **things to look for on the notice**:

- The **time and room** of the hearing. All hearings are at the Texas Capitol.
- Whether the hearing accepts **public testimony**. Invited testimony isn't what you're looking for. If the notice doesn't mention public testimony, **you can't testify**!
- The **time limit** on oral testimony. This is usually three minutes, but may be shorter for high-profile hearings.
- The **number of copies** to bring for written testimony.

The last two items will be more important later, when you are preparing your testimony.

### Useful sources of information

Apart from persistently checking TLO, there are other ways to get information about a bill.

First, TLO offers a robust **bill alert system**. The TLO website, under *My TLO*, will let you create an account with your email address. Then, you can add bills to your email alert list, and you'll get a nice email whenever the status of the bill changes (for instance, referral to a committee, or a hearing being scheduled).

Second, on controversial bills, **the media** can be a great way to follow a bill. Sources specific to Texas, such as the Texas Tribune, often post updates on when hearings are scheduled on high-profile legislation. They'll also give you information you can't get on TLO, like when SB 4 got [modified](https://www.texastribune.org/2017/02/01/texas-senate-adds-muscle-anti-sanctuary-city-legis/) a day before the hearing.

Preparing your testimony
-

Once you've found out when the hearing is happening, you need to prepare to testify before the committee.

### Planning your approach

As you put together your testimony, you need to decide two crucial items: your position on the bill and the format of your testimony.

All testimony takes one of three **positions**: for, against, or on a bill. The first two are obvious; the first supports the bill, and the second opposes it. The third is if you wish to offer information but remain neutral on the bill. Make sure you know which side you're on; for instance, since SB 4 was a bill to ban sanctuary cities, a supporter of sanctuary cities would testify against SB 4.

Testimony may be **formatted** in one of several ways: oral, written, or both. Oral testimony is a short speech given to the members of the committee, possibly followed by questioning from the members. Written testimony is a paper packet given to the legislators. If you don't want to or don't have time to speak, you can submit written testimony only; if you don't have time to write up your remarks, or a printer, you can opt for a solely oral approach. Optimally, you should do both. Keep in mind that some legislators won't be at the hearing, so not everyone will hear your oral testimony, but everyone can read the written testimony during or after the hearing.

### Types of testimony

There are two basic approaches you can take to argue your position on a bill.

**Objective** testimony relies on logic, facts, and figures. An objective witness cites sources, provides logically-organized points, and uses plenty of statistics. Anyone who's done competitive debate, extemporaneous speaking, or (especially) congressional debate will feel right at home with this approach. You can fit about two separate, complete arguments into a two- to three-minute period.

By contrast, **narrative** testimony tells a story. A narrative witness attempts to sway the committee with emotion, telling their own story or that of someone they know, and aims to show the legislators the human impact of their proposal. Narrative testimony is excellent if you're personally affected by the bill, since you're then the best suited to give your own unique perspective. Focus on telling one story; try not to tell multiple narratives, since you'll usually run out of time in the middle of one of them.

There's disagreement on which of these is most effective. My personal opinion is that both are important; the effect of hard numbers and figures can be amplified with stories that humanize some of those figures. A solid balance of both approaches builds a cogent case for your side.

At hearings with many witnesses, there will be a combination of objective and narrative witnesses. They will create that balance, so you really only need to pick one approach. For less controversial bills, where you have longer to testify, you can combine the approaches; either start with a narrative and then show its broader impact with numbers, or start with data and then personalize it at the end.

### Conducting research

Now's the time to gather information that you'll need in your testimony, and to back up your position for questioning. Even if you're taking a purely narrative approach, this information may influence how you present your story, or may be important to respond to questions.

First, **read the bill**. This sounds terrifying, but most bills are fairly short. It also is important; if a legislator asks you "Have you read the bill?", your answer should never be "no". The Texas Legislative Council has an excellent [resource](http://www.tlc.state.tx.us/docs/legref/readingabill.pdf) on reading bills. Some things to note:
- Watch for any **amendments** to the bill, and read them. These are usually listed on the TLO page, but not always. Check TLO and major Texas news sources frequently in the run-up to the hearing.
- Pay attention to the **nuances** of the bill. Most bills do one thing primarily, but also have other provisions. For instance, SB 4, while it bans sanctuary cities, also bans state officers from making a traffic stop solely because of presumed immigration status (in most cases). Legislators use these parts of a bill to counter common arguments against it, and make their own arguments in favor of the bill. You should know what's in the bill so that you can discuss any aspect of it, and beat back any arguments based on its more arcane portions.

Second, the TLO page should contain a non-partisan **analysis** of the bill. This usually restates the bill's legalese in slightly-beautified but nearly-identical legalese, but it's still not a bad idea to look it over.

Third, many bills come with **fiscal notes** that outline any costs to the state. These are usually posted on TLO right before a committee hearing. The Texas Legislature absolutely hates spending money, so make sure you consider the fiscal note in your arguments.

Fourth, know the **members of the committee** and what they look like. Take special note of the chair and vice chair, who I'll discuss later.

Fifth, if you're preparing objective testimony, research the **facts behind your case**. You probably already know why you support your side of the bill, but an objective approach requires reliably-sourced analysis and data. If you're attending a high-profile hearing, try to dig up unique arguments that you don't think anyone will say&mdash;after hours of hearing the same arguments over and over again, everyone will appreciate a change of pace.
