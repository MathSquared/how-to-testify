Testifying before the Texas Legislature
=

*Alex Meed*

With the election of Donald Trump, there's been a lot of attention devoted lately to national politics. But there's another political arena that deserves the same amount of focus, or maybe more: your state legislature. Your state representatives and senators decide many of the policies that affect you; for instance, some of the bills filed in this session of the Texas Legislature include a ban on sanctuary cities, a bathroom bill, and a sharply-trimmed budget.

You can affect state legislative proceedings in many of the same ways you can affect national legislation, such as through calling or writing your legislator, or just voting in elections. But this guide will cover another important way to act: by testifying.

First, a little bit about me. I'm a student at the University of Texas at Austin, majoring in Computer Science (hence why this is on Github). On Thursday, February 2, 2017, I testified against [SB 4](http://www.legis.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=85R&Bill=SB4), a bill to defund sanctuary cities. I also have years of competitive speaking experience. I've drawn this guide from the knowledge I gained by testifying myself, as well as several online sources whose identities have since escaped me.

Almost every bill that passes through the Texas Legislature goes through a **committee**. The committees are small groups of legislators that specialize in a particular issue; for instance, the aforementioned SB 4 went before the Senate State Affairs Committee. Committees hold **hearings** to consider a bill. Most hearings will invite **public testimony**, where anyone can speak directly to the committee in support of or opposition to the bill. SB 4 was particularly controversial, drawing hundreds of people to the Capitol to testify. But most hearings only have a few witnesses, usually from major lobbying groups or think tanks. I'm hoping to change that&mdash;because testimony is a great way to alter the course of the Texas Legislature.

I'll discuss the testimony process in chronological order, ranging from preparing for your day at the Capitol to your three minutes before the committee. I suggest you **don't read this all at once**; it's way too much to take in at once. Instead, read each section as it becomes applicable, and apply those lessons to your testimony.

Enjoy!

Finding a hearing

### Finding a bill

So you want to testify before the Texas Legislature. That's great! First, you need to find the issue you're testifying on.

Every bill in the Texas Legislature has a **bill number**, which is unique to that session of the Legislature (a period of time without any intervening elections). For instance, the sanctuary cities bill that I testified on has bill number SB 4 (the SB stands for Senate Bill). In order to testify on a bill, you first need to find its bill number.

Your biggest resource for this is [Texas Legislature Online](http://legis.state.tx.us), or **TLO**. ([Mobile site](http://txlegis.com).) This contains information about every bill that's been filed, as well as the legislator that introduced it. You can go to *Legislation > Bill Lookup* (desktop) or *Bill Lookup* (mobile) to view a bill given its number, or *Search* (desktop) to find a bill given specific criteria.

### Identifying the hearing

Once you've found the bill, you need to identify its committee. This should be listed on the bill page, as well as in the list of actions at the bottom (something like "Referred to *committee name*"). This committee will schedule a hearing for the bill; if you see an entry in the action list labeled "Scheduled for public hearing on...", that date is when the bill will be heard.

Once you've identified the committee and the hearing date, you need to check the **hearing notice**. This contains the location and time of the hearing, as well as any limitations on your testimony. Under *Committees > Upcoming Meetings* (desktop) or *Committee Meetings* (mobile), you can see a list of future meetings by date and committee. Once you've found the hearing you're looking for, clicking an icon at the right (desktop) or the committee name (mobile) will bring up the notice.

There are four **things to look for on the notice**:

- The **time and room** of the hearing. All hearings are at the Texas Capitol.
- Whether the hearing accepts **public testimony**. Invited testimony isn't what you're looking for. If the notice doesn't mention public testimony, **you can't testify**!
- The **time limit** on oral testimony. This is usually three minutes, but may be shorter for high-profile hearings.
- The **number of copies** to bring for written testimony.

The last two items will be more important later, when you are preparing your testimony.

### Useful sources of information

Apart from persistently checking TLO, there are other ways to get information about a bill.

First, TLO offers a robust **bill alert system**. The TLO website, under *My TLO*, will let you create an account with your email address. Then, you can add bills to your email alert list, and you'll get a nice email whenever the status of the bill changes (for instance, referral to a committee, or a hearing being scheduled).

Second, on controversial bills, **the media** can be a great way to follow a bill. Sources specific to Texas, such as the Texas Tribune, often post updates on when hearings are scheduled on high-profile legislation. They'll also give you information you can't get on TLO, like when SB 4 got [modified](https://www.texastribune.org/2017/02/01/texas-senate-adds-muscle-anti-sanctuary-city-legis/) a day before the hearing.
