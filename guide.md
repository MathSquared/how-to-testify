Testifying before the Texas Legislature

*Alex Meed*

With the election of Donald Trump, there's been a lot of attention devoted lately to national politics. But there's another political arena that deserves the same amount of focus, or maybe more: your state legislature. Your state representatives and senators decide many of the policies that affect you; for instance, some of the bills filed in this session of the Texas Legislature include a ban on sanctuary cities, a bathroom bill, and a sharply-trimmed budget.

You can affect state legislative proceedings in many of the same ways you can affect national legislation, such as through calling or writing your legislator, or just voting in elections. But this guide will cover another important way to act: by testifying.

First, a little bit about me. I'm a student at the University of Texas at Austin, majoring in Computer Science (hence why this is on Github). On Thursday, February 2, 2017, I testified against [SB 4](http://www.legis.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=85R&Bill=SB4), a bill to defund sanctuary cities. I also have years of competitive speaking experience. I've drawn this guide from the knowledge I gained by testifying myself, as well as several online sources whose identities have since escaped me.

Almost every bill that passes through the Texas Legislature goes through a **committee**. The committees are small groups of legislators that specialize in a particular issue; for instance, the aforementioned SB 4 went before the Senate State Affairs Committee. Committees hold **hearings** to consider a bill. Most hearings will invite **public testimony**, where anyone can speak directly to the committee in support of or opposition to the bill. SB 4 was particularly controversial, drawing hundreds of people to the Capitol to testify. But most hearings only have a few witnesses, usually from major lobbying groups or think tanks. I'm hoping to change that&mdash;because testimony is a great way to alter the course of the Texas Legislature.

I'll discuss the testimony process in chronological order, ranging from preparing for your day at the Capitol to your three minutes before the committee. I suggest you **don't read this all at once**; it's way too much to take in at once. Instead, read each section as it becomes applicable, and apply those lessons to your testimony.

Enjoy!
